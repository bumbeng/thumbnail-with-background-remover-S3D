- follow this instructions, its the original code without removing background:
https://github.com/fabiorinaldus399/gcode-tumbnail-generator-for-Simplify3D

- add my StlToImg.py file to your folder 
- install rembg with command:
  pip install rembg 
  
  if you want to add more than one stl file to your buildplate it shows only the last added stl as thumbnail! You can combine it in simplify, export this file and import the combined stl! So You can get an thumbnail of more than 1 stl.
